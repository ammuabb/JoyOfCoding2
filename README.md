# JoyOfCoding2
Practice sessions for C programming covering various concepts of programming.
You can try the same questions in different programming languages to improve your coding skills!
Thank You All!

Day-1
Question1: Even if one duplicate is present then the group is not unique.
            Input: An array of integers
            Output: Array distinct/ Array not distinct
            Example: Following array is not distinct since the number 10 is duplicated. Array={2,6,10,14,18,10,3,7}
            
Question2: Count the frequency of numbers present in a group of numbers.The answer should be tabulated.
            Input: An array of integers
            Output: Number of times each number is repeated.
            Example: Array={2,6,10,14,18,10,3,7,11,15,19,3,7,10,14}
                     O/P:   2's: 1
                            6's: 1
                            10's: 3
                            14's: 2
                            18's: 1
                            and so on...(Note:Output isn't a pattern of even numbers; All numbers are included)
                            
Day-2
Question1: Duplicate numbers in array must be removed.
            Input: An array of integers.
            Output: An array of integers without duplication.
            Example: Array={1,2,2,3,4}
                     O/P: 1 2 3 4
                     
                     
Question2: Given an array of integers, and another integer K. Write a program to find indexes of 2 elements in an array which sum is equal to K.(Two sum problem)
            Example: Array={5,4,7,3,9,2}
                     Sum(K)=13
                     Output: Indices are found at 1 and 4
                             Indices are found at 4 and 1
