Day-1
Question1: Even if one duplicate is present then the group is not unique.
            Input: An array of integers
            Output: Array distinct/ Array not distinct
            Example: Following array is not distinct since the number 10 is duplicated. Array={2,6,10,14,18,10,3,7}
            
Question2: Count the frequency of numbers present in a group of numbers.The answer should be tabulated.
            Input: An array of integers
            Output: Number of times each number is repeated.
            Example: Array={2,6,10,14,18,10,3,7,11,15,19,3,7,10,14}
                     O/P:   2's: 1
                            6's: 1
                            10's: 3
                            14's: 2
                            18's: 1
                            and so on...(Note:Output isn't a pattern of even numbers; All numbers are included)
